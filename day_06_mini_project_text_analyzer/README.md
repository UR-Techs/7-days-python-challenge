# 📘 Day 6: Mini Project – Text Analyzer (CLI App)

## 🧠 Project Focus  
Today’s goal was to consolidate all Python knowledge learned so far into a **mini-project**. The challenge involved creating a **Text Analyzer** command-line application that processes a paragraph input and extracts useful text statistics using core Python logic.

---

## ✅ Objectives Achieved

- Accepted free-form paragraph input from the user
- Counted and displayed word frequencies
- Extracted and displayed all unique words
- Sorted words based on their frequency
- Identified the most frequently occurring word
- (Bonus) Grouped all words based on their starting letter

---

## 🧩 Concepts Practiced

- String manipulation (`.lower()`, `.split()`)
- Dictionary creation and frequency counting
- Conditional logic and iteration
- Sorting dictionary items using `lambda` and `sorted()`
- Finding maximum values using `max()` with `key`
- Grouping logic using nested dictionaries and lists

---

## 🔍 Reflection

This mini-project brought together all the building blocks from Days 1–5. While the logic was straightforward, chaining them into a functional app provided a new level of hands-on confidence. It was also a practical introduction to designing real-world CLI tools using basic Python, and it opens doors for future upgrades such as punctuation handling, stopword filtering, or file input/output.

💡 **Bonus Idea for the Future**:  
Integrate this CLI tool with file reading, export analysis as a report, or even build a simple GUI on top.
