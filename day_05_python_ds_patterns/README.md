# 📘 Day 5: Python + DSA Challenge

## 🧠 Focus  
Day 5 emphasized practicing **Python patterns** that frequently appear in backend logic and data processing. The focus was on list comprehension, dictionary operations, and grouping logic — all implemented with clean, beginner-friendly code.

---

## ✅ Objectives Achieved

- Filtered and transformed lists using list comprehension
- Sorted dictionary items by value using `lambda`
- Removed duplicates from a list while preserving original order
- Merged two dictionaries with value summation for overlapping keys
- Grouped words by their starting letter into dictionary buckets

---

## 🧩 Concepts Practiced

- List comprehension with conditions
- Lambda-based sorting of key-value pairs
- Set for duplicate detection and filtering
- Dictionary merging with key conflict resolution
- Manual grouping logic vs. using `defaultdict` from `collections`

## 🔍 Reflection

This day reinforced a number of core Python techniques while gradually shifting from basic syntax to pattern-based thinking. The exercises required chaining multiple concepts together — conditionals, loops, set/dictionary handling — to produce structured and readable code. It also highlighted multiple ways to solve the same problem (e.g., grouping words using both manual dict and `defaultdict`).
