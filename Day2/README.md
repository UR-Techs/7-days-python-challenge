# ðŸ“˜ Day 2 â€“ Pythonic Patterns: enumerate, zip, list comprehension

### âœ… Today's Focus:
- Using built-in functions to write cleaner, more Pythonic code
- Practicing with list and dictionary operations

---

### ðŸ§ª Problems Solved:

1. **Enumerate List Items**  
   Printed each item in a list with its index using `enumerate()`.

2. **Merge Lists to Dict**  
   Combined two related lists into a dictionary using `zip()` and `dict()`.

3. **Even Squares**  
   Used list comprehension to filter even numbers and return their squares from a range.

### ðŸ§  Learnings:
Python has powerful built-in tools like `enumerate`, `zip`, and list comprehensions. Once you start using them, it feels like speaking the language fluently.
