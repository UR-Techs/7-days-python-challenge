📘 Day 4 - Python + DSA Challenge
✅ Today's Focus
Day 4 focused on improving problem-solving using:

Arithmetic operations for finding patterns (missing number)

String manipulation and dictionary usage for text analysis

Efficient set operations for comparing collections

🔍 Reflection
Today was about solidifying logic and syntax for everyday programming problems. These problems simulate real-world scenarios involving data loss, search, and text analysis — all critical in interviews and backend systems.
