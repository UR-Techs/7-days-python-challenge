# ðŸ“˜ Day 4 â€“ Sets, Dictionaries & Searching Patterns

### âœ… Today's Focus:
- Practiced searching patterns and counting using sets and dictionaries.
- Focused on efficient solutions using Pythonic constructs.
- Continued building up for the final real-world project on Day 8.

### ðŸ§ª Problems Solved:

1. **Find the Missing Number**  
   *Problem:* Given a list of n-1 numbers in range 1 to n, find the missing number.  
   *Concepts used:* Math (sum formula), set difference.

   **Input:** `[1, 2, 4, 5]`  
   **Output:** `3`

2. **Count Word Occurrences in a Sentence**  
   *Problem:* Count how many times each word appears in a sentence, case-insensitively.  
   *Concepts used:* `str.lower()`, `str.split()`, dictionary-based counting.

   **Input:** `"Python is great and python is easy"`  
   **Output:** `{'python': 2, 'is': 2, 'great': 1, 'and': 1, 'easy': 1}`

3. **Check if Two Lists Have Common Elements**  
   *Problem:* Write a function to check whether two lists have at least one common element.  
   *Concepts used:* Set intersection.

   **Input:** `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 3]`  
   **Output:** `True`

### ðŸ§  Key Learnings:
- Sets are excellent for membership checks and detecting duplicates or overlaps.
- Dictionaries are powerful tools for pattern tracking and frequency counting.
- Clean, Pythonic code = readable + scalable logic.
