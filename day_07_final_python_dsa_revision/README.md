# 📘 Day 7 – Final Python + DSA Revision

## 🧠 Focus Area  
Day 7 was about revising the most impactful 20% of Python and DSA concepts that give 80% of the utility in real-world problem solving. The goal was to practice Pythonic approaches to filtering, transforming, merging, and sorting data structures efficiently.

## ✅ Exercises Completed

### 1. **Word Length Filter**
Filtered words longer than 4 characters using list comprehension, reinforcing conditional filtering.

### 2. **Dictionary Frequency Sort (Descending)**
Practiced sorting dictionary items using `lambda` and `sorted()` with the `reverse=True` flag for descending order, strengthening control over dictionary structures.

### 3. **Conditional Transformation**
Used list comprehension to square even numbers and cube odd numbers in a list — combining `if-else` logic with iteration in a concise way.

### 4. **Merge & Deduplicate Sorted Lists**
Merged two sorted lists using set union and sorted the result to ensure deduplication and order preservation — applying set operations and `sorted()` for real-world use cases.

- List comprehension with conditionals
- Lambda functions and dictionary sorting
- Conditional value transformation
- Set operations for deduplication
- Efficient Python idioms for data processing

## 🔍 Reflection

Today’s revision felt like a final warm-up lap before the Day 8 project. It was satisfying to see how clean and powerful Python can be with just a few lines of code. Concepts like list comprehensions, `lambda`, and set operations now feel second nature.

💡 **Looking Ahead:**  
With this strong foundation, I'm now ready to build the Day 8 project — something meaningful, functional, and portfolio-worthy using everything I've learned in the past week.
