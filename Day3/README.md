# ðŸ“˜ Day 3 â€“ Strings, Frequency & Anagrams

### âœ… Today's Focus:
- Practiced string manipulations and frequency analysis
- Solved problems that blended Python features with common DSA patterns

---

### ðŸ§ª Problems Solved:

1. **Reverse Words in a Sentence**  
   Reversed the order of words in a given sentence using split and join.

2. **Most Frequent Character**  
   Counted character frequency (excluding spaces) and identified the most frequent one.

3. **Check Anagrams**  
   Verified if two input strings are anagrams using `collections.Counter`.

### ðŸ§  Learnings:
String operations and character frequency analysis are foundational in both Python and DSA. Using tools like `.split()`, `.join()`, slicing, and `Counter()` makes the logic both efficient and readable.
